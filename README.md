# 🚀 In-Depth Analysis in Solidity Smart Contracts

> 📊 A research project exploring gas optimization patterns in Ethereum smart contracts

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains experimental code and research on gas consumption patterns in Solidity smart contracts. We dive deep into error handling, validation approaches, and arithmetic operations to help you write more efficient contracts! 

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Setting up Python Environment(macOS)
First, let's get your Python environment ready for the automation scripts! We'll use a virtual environment to keep things clean and isolated.
```bash
# 1️⃣ Create a fresh virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2️⃣ Activate it (choose based on your OS)
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3️⃣ Install all the goodies
pip install -r package from .py file
```

### 📁 Project Structure

├── 🐍 scripts/           # Python magic happens here
├── 📝 contracts/         # All our Solidity wisdom
├── 📊 figures/          # Beautiful visualizations (generated by scripts)
└── 📚 latex/            # The academic stuff
```

## 💡 What's Inside?

### 🔮 Smart Contracts (`/contracts`)
Explore our collection of carefully crafted contracts demonstrating:
- 🛑 Error handling patterns (`assert` vs `require` vs `revert`)
- ✅ Validation techniques (modifiers vs direct checks)
- 🧮 Safe arithmetic operations
- 💸 ETH transfer methods

### 🤖 Automation Scripts (`.py scripts`)
Cool Python scripts to:
- Generate gas consumption visualizations
- Process transaction data
- Make your research life easier!

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Analysis

1. Set up your environment (see above ⬆️)
2. Deploy contracts using Remix IDE
3. Run the analysis:
```bash
python analyst.py
```
4. Check out the beautiful charts in `/figures`!

## 🔍 Key Findings

Our research revealed some interesting patterns:
- 📈 Version 0.8.0+ has better security but slightly higher gas costs
- 🎯 Modifiers are worth the tiny gas overhead
- 🔒 SafeMath vs native checks trade-offs
